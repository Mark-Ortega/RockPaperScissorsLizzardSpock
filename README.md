### Struggled a lot with this project and apart from the main functionality of the javascript such as the game itself and the CPU API, i struggled with getting the difficulty and gamemode itself onto another page to which i then decided instead of having three pages, i now have two. I could not for the life of me figure out how to make it function with three pages. Once i did that i was able to get more help on hiding buttons on my second page so i dont just have buttons you can click everywhere. I also didn't finish in time and was going to turn the project in without javascript functionality but ended up sleeping through my alarm for a peer review so i decided that i should take my chances and just finish the javascript and turn it in late since it was overdue already. Also makes it good/needed practice. I used plenty of resources from my javascript badge to W3Schools and had tons of help from classmates. Overall, definitely underestimated this project and stressed because of it. I also should've created an easier flowchart.

### Peer Review: Game works as it should. I enjoyed the vibe of Caleb-ness. Only issues I could find were when you play the player two score text overrides player one's score text. And collapsing the rules moves the game area. Other then those issues the game is good.
